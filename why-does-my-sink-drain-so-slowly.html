      <h1>Why Does My Sink Drain So Slowly?</h1>

      <!-- Quick Answer -->
      <p class="quick-answer">
        A sink usually drains slowly because of partial clogs caused by grease,
        soap residue, food particles, hair, or mineral buildup inside the drain pipe.
        Over time, these materials restrict water flow and reduce drainage speed.

      <h2>Why Slow Sink Drains Are So Common</h2>
      <p>
        Sink drains are used multiple times every day.
        Small amounts of debris enter the drain
        each time water flows down.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unlike complete blockages,
        slow drains develop gradually,
        making them easy to ignore
        until the problem becomes worse.
      </p>

      <h2>Most Common Causes of a Slow-Draining Sink</h2>

      <h3>Grease and Oil Buildup</h3>
      <p>
        In kitchen sinks,
        grease and oil are the leading causes
        of slow drainage.
        When grease cools,
        it hardens inside pipes
        and traps food particles.
      </p>

      <h3>Soap Scum and Residue</h3>
      <p>
        Soap residue combines with minerals in water
        to form sticky buildup.
        This buildup narrows pipes
        and slows water flow,
        especially in bathroom sinks.
      </p>

      <h3>Hair and Personal Care Products</h3>
      <p>
        Hair, toothpaste,
        shaving cream,
        and cosmetics
        often collect inside bathroom drains.
        These materials form partial clogs
        that restrict drainage.
      </p>

      <h3>Food Particles and Debris</h3>
      <p>
        Even small food scraps
        can accumulate over time,
        especially when sink strainers are not used.
      </p>

      <h3>Mineral Buildup from Hard Water</h3>
      <p>
        Hard water leaves mineral deposits
        inside pipes.
        Over time,
        these deposits reduce pipe diameter
        and slow drainage.
      </p>

      <h2>Signs a Slow Drain Is Getting Worse</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Water pooling in the sink</li>
        <li>Gurgling sounds when draining</li>
        <li>Unpleasant odors from the drain</li>
        <li>Drainage slowing over time</li>
        <li>Water backing up slightly</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to Fix a Slow Sink Drain</h2>

      <h3>Clean the Drain Stopper and Strainer</h3>
      <p>
        Remove and clean the drain stopper
        and strainer.
        Hair and debris often collect here
        and are easy to remove.
      </p>

      <h3>Flush the Drain with Hot Water</h3>
      <p>
        Hot water helps dissolve grease
        and loosen buildup.
        Pour slowly to avoid splashing.
      </p>

      <h3>Use Baking Soda and Vinegar</h3>
      <p>
        Pour baking soda into the drain,
        followed by vinegar.
        Let it sit,
        then flush with hot water.
        This method helps break down residue.
      </p>

      <h3>Manually Remove Partial Clogs</h3>
      <p>
        A drain snake or flexible brush
        can remove hair and debris
        deeper in the pipe.
      </p>

      <h2>What to Avoid When Fixing Slow Drains</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Using harsh chemical drain cleaners</li>
        <li>Pouring grease down the sink</li>
        <li>Ignoring recurring slow drainage</li>
        <li>Forcing objects down the drain</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to Prevent Slow Sink Drains</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use sink strainers</li>
        <li>Dispose of grease properly</li>
        <li>Flush drains with hot water weekly</li>
        <li>Clean drain stoppers regularly</li>
        <li>Avoid excessive soap use</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>When a Slow Drain Indicates a Bigger Plumbing Problem</h2>
      <p>
        If multiple sinks drain slowly,
        the issue may be deeper
        in the plumbing system.
      </p>

      <p>
        Recurring slow drains
        can indicate main line clogs
        or pipe damage.
      </p>

      <h2>When Should You Call a Plumber?</h2>
      <p>
        Call a professional if:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>The drain keeps slowing after cleaning</li>
        <li>Water backs up into other fixtures</li>
        <li>You notice strong drain odors</li>
        <li>Gurgling sounds persist</li>
      </ul>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <h3>Can a slow drain turn into a complete clog?</h3>
        <p style="display:none;">
          Yes. Slow drains usually worsen over time
          if the underlying buildup is not removed.
        </p>

        <h3>Is boiling water safe for sink drains?</h3>
        <p style="display:none;">
          Boiling water can help with grease,
          but should be used carefully
          to avoid damaging plastic pipes.
        </p>

        <h3>How often should drains be cleaned?</h3>
        <p style="display:none;">
          Light maintenance monthly
          helps prevent slow drainage problems.
