      <h2>Why Many Drain-Cleaning Methods Damage Pipes</h2>
      <p>
        Many homeowners rely on chemical drain cleaners
        for quick results.
        While these products may clear clogs temporarily,
        they often damage pipes internally.
      </p>

      <p>
        Chemicals generate heat,
        corrode metal,
        weaken plastic pipes,
        and shorten the lifespan
        of the entire plumbing system.
      </p>

      <h2>Common Causes of Drain Clogs</h2>
      <p>
        Understanding what causes clogs
        helps you choose the safest removal method.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Grease and oil buildup</li>
        <li>Hair and soap residue</li>
        <li>Food particles</li>
        <li>Mineral deposits from hard water</li>
        <li>Foreign objects flushed or washed down drains</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Safe Methods to Unclog Drains</h2>

      <h3>Flush with Hot (Not Boiling) Water</h3>
      <p>
        Hot water helps dissolve grease
        and loosen soap buildup.
        Pour slowly to allow heat
        to work through the clog.
      </p>

      <p>
        Avoid boiling water
        if you have plastic pipes,
        as extreme heat can cause damage.
      </p>

      <h3>Use Baking Soda and Vinegar</h3>
      <p>
        Pour baking soda into the drain,
        followed by vinegar.
        The reaction helps break down residue
        without harming pipes.
      </p>

      <p>
        After waiting 15–30 minutes,
        flush with hot water.
      </p>

      <h3>Use a Plunger Correctly</h3>
      <p>
        A plunger creates pressure
        that dislodges clogs mechanically.
        Ensure a tight seal
        and use controlled movements.
      </p>

      <h3>Remove and Clean Drain Traps</h3>
      <p>
        Sink traps often collect debris.
        Carefully removing and cleaning the trap
        can eliminate clogs quickly
        without pipe damage.
      </p>

      <h3>Use a Drain Snake or Cleaning Brush</h3>
      <p>
        Manual drain snakes or brushes
        remove hair and debris
        deeper inside pipes.
        They are safe when used gently.
      </p>

      <h2>What to Avoid When Unclogging Drains</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Chemical drain cleaners</li>
        <li>Sharp or rigid tools</li>
        <li>Excessive force or pressure</li>
        <li>Repeated boiling water use</li>
        <li>Ignoring recurring clogs</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to Prevent Future Drain Clogs</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use drain strainers in sinks and showers</li>
        <li>Dispose of grease in trash, not drains</li>
        <li>Flush drains with hot water weekly</li>
        <li>Clean drain stoppers regularly</li>
        <li>Limit soap and product buildup</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>When Gentle Methods Are Not Enough</h2>
      <p>
        Persistent or recurring clogs
        may indicate deeper plumbing issues,
        such as pipe damage
        or main line blockages.
      </p>

      <p>
        In these cases,
        professional inspection
        is the safest option.
      </p>

      <h2>When Should You Call a Plumber?</h2>
      <p>
        Contact a professional if:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Multiple drains clog at once</li>
        <li>Water backs up into other fixtures</li>
        <li>Clogs return frequently</li>
        <li>You notice foul odors or gurgling sounds</li>
      </ul>
