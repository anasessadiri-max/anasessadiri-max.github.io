        Proper plumbing maintenance involves regular inspections, safe daily habits,
        early leak detection, drain care, and protecting pipes from pressure,
        temperature changes, and buildup. Consistent maintenance prevents costly
        repairs and extends the lifespan of plumbing systems.

      <h2>Why Plumbing Maintenance Is Important</h2>
      <p>
        Home plumbing systems operate daily
        and are often taken for granted
        until a problem occurs.
        Small issues like slow drains or minor leaks
        can develop into major damage
        if ignored.
      </p>

      <p>
        Regular maintenance helps prevent emergencies,
        reduces water waste,
        protects property,
        and saves money over time.
      </p>

      <h2>Understand Your Home Plumbing System</h2>
      <p>
        A typical home plumbing system
        consists of supply lines,
        drain pipes,
        fixtures,
        valves,
        and appliances.
      </p>

      <p>
        Knowing where shut-off valves are located
        and how water flows through your home
        makes maintenance and emergency response easier.
      </p>

      <h2>Inspect for Leaks Regularly</h2>
      <p>
        Small leaks often go unnoticed
        because they occur behind walls
        or under sinks.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Check under sinks for moisture</li>
        <li>Inspect visible pipes for corrosion</li>
        <li>Monitor water bills for unexplained increases</li>
        <li>Look for water stains on walls or ceilings</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Maintain Drains to Prevent Clogs</h2>
      <p>
        Drain maintenance is one of the most effective
        ways to avoid plumbing problems.
        Most clogs develop slowly
        due to buildup.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Use drain strainers in sinks and showers</li>
        <li>Flush drains with hot water weekly</li>
        <li>Avoid pouring grease down drains</li>
        <li>Clean drain stoppers regularly</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Protect Pipes from Pressure and Damage</h2>
      <p>
        High water pressure
        places stress on pipes and fittings.
        Over time,
        this increases the risk of leaks and bursts.
      </p>

      <p>
        Installing a pressure regulator
        and avoiding sudden pressure changes
        helps protect plumbing components.
      </p>

      <h2>Prevent Pipe Damage from Temperature Changes</h2>
      <p>
        Pipes expand and contract
        with temperature changes.
        Cold temperatures can cause pipes to freeze,
        while hot water accelerates wear.
      </p>

      <p>
        Insulating exposed pipes
        and maintaining stable indoor temperatures
        reduces stress on the system.
      </p>

      <h2>Maintain Plumbing Fixtures and Appliances</h2>
      <p>
        Faucets, toilets, washing machines,
        and dishwashers
        rely on proper plumbing maintenance.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Fix dripping faucets immediately</li>
        <li>Check toilet components periodically</li>
        <li>Clean appliance hoses and filters</li>
        <li>Replace worn washers and seals</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Avoid Harmful Plumbing Habits</h2>
      <p>
        Many plumbing problems
        are caused by improper use.
        Avoiding harmful habits
        significantly reduces system stress.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Do not flush wipes or hygiene products</li>
        <li>Avoid chemical drain cleaners</li>
        <li>Do not overload garbage disposals</li>
        <li>Do not ignore slow drains</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Schedule Preventive Inspections</h2>
      <p>
        Periodic professional inspections
        help identify hidden problems early.
        This is especially important
        for older homes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Preventive maintenance
        costs far less
        than emergency plumbing repairs.
      </p>

      <h2>Signs Your Plumbing System Needs Attention</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Frequent clogs or slow drains</li>
        <li>Low or fluctuating water pressure</li>
        <li>Unusual noises in pipes</li>
        <li>Recurring leaks</li>
        <li>Mold or water damage</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>When Should You Call a Professional Plumber?</h2>
      <p>
        Call a professional if:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Leaks keep returning</li>
        <li>Multiple fixtures are affected</li>
        <li>You suspect hidden pipe damage</li>
        <li>Water pressure changes suddenly</li>
      </ul>
