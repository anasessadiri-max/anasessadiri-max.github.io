      <h2>Why Furniture Gets Damaged During Cleaning</h2>
      <p>
        Many furniture surfaces are damaged not by use,
        but by improper cleaning.
        Harsh chemicals, rough sponges,
        and excessive moisture
        slowly break down finishes and materials.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over time, improper cleaning
        can cause fading, cracking,
        peeling, and surface dullness.
      </p>

      <h2>General Rules for Safe Furniture Cleaning</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Always test cleaners on a hidden area first</li>
        <li>Use soft microfiber or cotton cloths</li>
        <li>Avoid soaking surfaces with water</li>
        <li>Clean gently without aggressive scrubbing</li>
        <li>Dry surfaces immediately after cleaning</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to Clean Wooden Furniture Safely</h2>
      <p>
        Wood surfaces are sensitive to moisture and chemicals.
        Use a slightly damp cloth
        with mild soap if needed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Wipe in the direction of the wood grain,
        then dry immediately.
        Avoid ammonia, bleach,
        and alcohol-based cleaners.
      </p>

      <h2>Cleaning Painted or Finished Furniture</h2>
      <p>
        Painted and lacquered surfaces
        can scratch easily.
        Dust regularly with a dry cloth,
        and clean using mild soap and water only when necessary.
      </p>

      <p>
        Never use abrasive sponges,
        as they remove protective coatings.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Clean Leather Furniture Without Damage</h2>

        Use a dry or slightly damp cloth
        to remove dust and dirt.
      </p>

      <p>
        For deeper cleaning,

      <h2>Cleaning Fabric Upholstery Safely</h2>
      <p>
        Fabric furniture absorbs liquids easily.
        Vacuum regularly to remove dust and debris.
      </p>

      <p>
        For stains,
        blot gently with a damp cloth.
        Avoid rubbing,
        which can spread stains and damage fibers.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Clean Glass and Metal Furniture Parts</h2>
      <p>
        Glass and metal surfaces
        are easier to clean
        but still require care.
      </p>

      <p>
        Use non-abrasive cleaners
        and soft cloths
        to avoid scratches and streaks.
      </p>

      <h2>Common Furniture Cleaning Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Using bleach or strong chemicals</li>
        <li>Scrubbing with rough brushes</li>
        <li>Spraying cleaner directly onto furniture</li>
        <li>Ignoring manufacturer care instructions</li>
        <li>Leaving moisture on surfaces</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How Often Should Furniture Be Cleaned?</h2>
      <p>
        Light dusting should be done weekly.
        Deeper cleaning depends on usage,
        environment,
        and material type.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over-cleaning can be just as harmful
        as neglect.
      </p>

      <h2>Protecting Furniture After Cleaning</h2>
      <p>
        After cleaning,
        proper protection helps extend furniture life.
        This includes avoiding direct sunlight,
        controlling humidity,
        and using appropriate conditioners when needed.
